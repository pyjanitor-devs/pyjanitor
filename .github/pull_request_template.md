# PR Checklist

<!-- This checklist exists for newcomers who are not yet familiar with our requirements. If you are experienced with
the project, please feel free to delete this section. -->

Please ensure that you have done the following:

1. [ ] PR in from a fork off your branch. Do not PR from `<your_username>`:`dev`, but rather from `<your_username>`:`<feature-branch_name>`.
<!-- Doing this helps us keep the commit history much cleaner than it would otherwise be. -->
2. [ ] If you're not on the contributors list, add yourself to `AUTHORS.rst`.
<!-- We'd like to acknowledge your contributions! -->
3. [ ] Add a line to `CHANGELOG.md` under the latest version header (i.e. the one that is "on deck") describing the contribution.
    - Do use some discretion here; if there are multiple PRs that are related, keep them in a single line.

# Automatic checks

There will be automatic checks run on the PR. These include:

- Building a preview of the docs on Netlify
- Automatically linting the code
- Making sure the code is documented
- Making sure that all tests are passed
- Making sure that code coverage doesn't go down.

# Relevant Reviewers

<!-- Finally, please tag relevant maintainers to review. -->

Please tag maintainers to review.
