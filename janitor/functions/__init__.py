# General Functions

pyjanitor's general-purpose data cleaning functions.

NOTE: Instructions for future contributors:

1. Place the source code of the functions in a file named after the function.
2. Place utility functions in the same file.
3. If you use a utility function from another source file,
please refactor it out to `janitor.functions.utils`.
4. Import the function into this file so that it shows up in the top-level API.
5. Sort the imports in alphabetical order.
6. Try to group related functions together (e.g. see `convert_date.py`)
7. Never import utils.
